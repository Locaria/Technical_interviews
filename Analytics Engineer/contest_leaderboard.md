# Contest Leaderboard

You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the `hacker_id`, `name`, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending `hacker_id`. Exclude all hackers with a total score of `0` from your result.

## Input Format

The following tables contain contest data:

### Hackers Table
- Column: `hacker_id` (Integer) – The ID of the hacker.
- Column: `name` (String) – The name of the hacker.

### Submissions Table
- Column: `submission_id` (Integer) – The ID of the submission.
- Column: `hacker_id` (Integer) – The ID of the hacker who made the submission.
- Column: `challenge_id` (Integer) – The ID of the challenge for which the submission belongs.
- Column: `score` (Integer) – The score of the submission.
